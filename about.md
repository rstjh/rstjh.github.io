Commensurate is a specialist consultancy providing a range of Governance, Risk Management and Compliance services for businesses, professional services, critical infrastructure, defense and government. 

Through a range of service offerings we work with relevant stakeholders to advise, review, recommend, test, implement and evaluate policies and procedures which enable client objectives to be met with confidence. 

Founded in 2010, Commensurate offers a comprehensive business-focused approach. 

Our consultants, all of whom are formally trained and hold baseline (SC) Security Clearance, can provide professional support in all aspects of the below points. For clients operating at higher business impact levels or where sensitive assets are held we can provide dedicated experts with unexpired clearances at those higher levels. 

We believe security should be a business enabler – not a hindrance; we are happy for potential clients to review our security credentials and for our professionals to undergo formal vetting for government contracts or bespoke vetting according to a private client’s own business policies.

### Cyber Security 

Cyber-security threats affect all businesses and organisations irrespective of their size, business model or culture. If your business is deemed to have value to an adversary they will utilise a range of attack vectors in order to achieve their objective. As such, your business needs to prepare to defend itself.

Threats can arise from business operations ranging from storing or processing sensitive information to your supply chain and anything in between.

Commensurate has developed an approach comprising four areas, Prepare, Protect, Respond and Learn:

### Prepare
It is important to ascertain the maturity of your organisation to address the ever changing threats. Effective understanding of the evolving threat landscape combined with your organisations cyber-security posture enables you to intelligently invest in resources.
Our Prepare services help you understand how you are meeting your business security objectives and enable informed decisions to occur.

### Protect
Defending your business from the wide range of threats is vital to reduce your attack surface from being exploited. Controls can be aligned to Personnel, Physical, Procedural and Technological measures. There is no ‘silver bullet’ that will prevent security events from occurring, however, you can demonstrate a responsible approach to protecting your business assets (People, Processes, Information, Technologies, and Facilities).

### Respond
The legal and regulatory landscape is fundamentally changing by placing a range of obligations in the event of a cyber incident. Notification obligations place a specific time-frame where you must submit a statement that a security incident has occurred. Our knowledge, experience, and business driven approach can enable your business to achieve these requirements with ease.

### Learn
An often overlooked, but vital, stage when responding to a security event is learning from your own and interested party’s performance. Irrespective of how mature your business is, there are always lessons that can be gleaned from the experience. Commensurate has handled a wide range of cyber security related incidents and we run a formal review following each and every one of them. The threat landscape is constantly evolving and businesses need to adapt ensuring measured an consistent responses, every time.
